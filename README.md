## Uploading Images and Youtube videos


<h1> Uploading Images to Github </h1>

<p>In this section, we'll learn how to upload images to your Github account.  This is often more effective than simply taking image links from the web.  Web links are unstable;  the image could be deleted or simply moved to another location.</p>

<p>We'll find a picture of a cat to display on my webpage.</p>

<p>...and save it to the desktop.</p>

<p>Then, go to the Github repository (github.com/your-repository-name)</p>

<p>Now, we're going to learn how to embed Youtube videos in our websites. Embedding simply means to incorporate data, such as a video, within the body of a web page.  This is both easy and useful, as it allows us to display fully functional videos by just copying and pasting a bit of code.  First, find the video you want to embed. Then, click the link below the video that says "Embed."</p>

<p>You can do the same with Soundcloud.  Just find the track you want to embed and click the Embed link.</p>
