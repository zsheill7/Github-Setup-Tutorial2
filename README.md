## Uploading Images and Youtube videos

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zsheill7/Github-Setup-Tutorial2/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

<h1> Uploading Images to Github </h1>

In this section, we'll learn how to upload images to your Github account.  This is often more effective than simply taking image links from the web.  Web links are unstable;  the image could be deleted or simply moved to another location.

We'll find a picture of a cat to display on my webpage.
<img src="Screenshot1.png" alt="search cat">

...and save it to the desktop.

Then, go to the Github repository (github.com/your-repository-name)

Click "Upload files"

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zsheill7/Github-Setup-Tutorial2/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
